# Millionaire Quiz Project

A quiz game similar in idea to the famous TV show - Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

Each player must create an account in order to be able to play. The password for the account must contain an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter and a digit.

If the user forgets their password, they have the option to retrive it through a confirmation letter sent to their email.

The game consists of 16 questions on FMI related subjects. Each question rewards the player with a certain amount of virtual credits (the currency in the game).

The game ends when either of the 3 conditions occurs:
- the user has given a wrong answer
- the user has answered all questions correctly
- the user has decided to end the game by clicking on the "Give Up" button

There are 3 hints with the player being able to use each once throughout the game:
- Ask a Colleagu–µ : see what the most probable answer is
- 50 / 50 : remove 2 of the wrong answers
- Look up on Internet : see the probability of each answer being correct

A rankings table shows the current position of the user compared to the others according to their accumulated virtual credits.
